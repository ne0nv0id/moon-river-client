# Moon River: SEI Final Project

Moon River is a personal blog about jazz music, paying homage to American singer Frank Sinatra. To fit the poetic agenda, the back-end for this application is written in Sinatra - a Ruby framework capable of making lightweight or incredibly heavy-duty back-ends and APIs.

## Sinatra as a Framework

A technology is effective when it can be learned by all, used by many, and mastered by few. Sinatra presented me with several challenges during this project:
- Poor documentation: The docs did little to go beyond teaching me how to write a basic "Hello World" route to show up in the browser.
- A wide spectrum of uses: As I stated earlier, Sinatra can be used for thin and lightweight applications, but it can also be scaled to work with advanced securities and larger databases.
- Wide spectrum, cont: Due to Sinatra's flexible and adaptable nature, creating a simple API proved difficult - most resources online pointed to larger-scale apps or back to Ruby on Rails.

## A Standing Ovation

Pushing myself to learn a new framework had many benefits despite the frustration I encountered. Not only did I better my understanding of how organic and easily-used Ruby's syntax is, I also tested my ability to problem solve with little to no guidance. After what must have been 15 failed iterations, I was finally able to develop a very lightweight, working API (with help) and proceed to finishing my project.
